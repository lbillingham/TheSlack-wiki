# The Judy2k Slack

The Judy2k Slack is intended to be an inclusive, welcoming, respectful place for (mainly technical) people to hang out. The majority of us are in Edinburgh but that's not a rule!

## Admins

The following people have admin rights in the Slack. They are the people to talk to if you need help or if you have problems with or concerns about someone in the Judy2k Slack. Feel free to contact them in a private channel.

* @ali (Ali King)
* @carrot (Sky Welch)
* @judy2k (Mark Smith)

## Policies

* You are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct). 
* You can invite new people to the Slack! You don't need to ask permission, but please consider whether the person will adhere to the [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) before inviting them.
* You must set an avatar image! It doesn't need to be a photo of you, but @judy2k hates plaid.

## Code of Conduct

Policing a code of conduct in a live and ephemeral medium like Slack is challenging. If you want the admins to take action based on the code of conduct, please contact them ASAP so that they can be effective.

* No-one is to be made to feel uncomfortable for **any reason**, especially those related to gender, race, sexual orientation, or belief. If someone asks you to stop doing something, stop doing it.
* Conversations about jobseeking in #jobs are private and sensitive, and are not to be shared outside of the Slack.
* If you have a problem or concern in the Slack (or you witness someone breaking the Code of Conduct) please open a private channel with the admins to discuss it. You will be taken seriously.
* If you have a problem or concern with one of the admins, please open a private channel with the _other_ admins to discuss it. You will be taken seriously.
